Santa Claus Christmas Present Management System (Software Design Methods Project)

## Project Description

This project was Areen Said's ([Southgarden116](https://github.com/Southgarden116)) and Iris Schaffer's ([irisSchaffer](https://github.com/irisSchaffer)) semester project for the course *IM410 - Software Design Methods* of the master degree *Interactive Media* at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg Campus](http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus).

Our goal was to create a christmas present management system for Santa Claus. Children are able to write letters to Santa and, if they were good children (and/or put cookies and milk out), receive presents.

Santa gets notified when a child puts his/her wish list on the window sill, takes the wish list, lets the elves produce the presents (and wrap them in gift wrap of different colour and pattern) and in the end delivers them to the childrenâ€™s houses.

Santa also has an archive of christmas records for each child in which he collects each year's wish list and the child's niceness.
