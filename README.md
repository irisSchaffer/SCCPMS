# SCCPMS
Santa Claus Christmas Present Management System (Software Design Methods Project)

## The assignment

This project was Areen Said's ([Southgarden116](https://github.com/Southgarden116)) and Iris Schaffer's ([irisSchaffer](https://github.com/irisSchaffer)) semester project for the *IM410 - Software Design Methods* class of the master degree *Interactive Media* at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg Campus](http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus). The goal was not to create production code but to apply the knowledge about design patterns and software architecture gained in the *Software Design Methods* class in an example project using TDD.

## Project Description

Our aim was to create a christmas present management system for Santa Claus. Children are able to write letters to Santa and, if they were good children (and/or put cookies and milk out), receive presents.

Santa gets notified when a child puts his/her wish list on the window sill, takes the wish list, lets the elves produce the presents (and wrap them in gift wrap of different colour and pattern) and in the end delivers them to the childrenâ€™s houses.

Santa also has an archive of christmas records for each child in which he collects each year's wish list and the child's niceness.
