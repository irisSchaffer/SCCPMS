###### 08.12.2014

Skype conversation to brainstorm, discuss ideas and write project proposal

### Project Proposal Key Words:

- Santa Claus christmas present management system
- Children —> write wishlists and receive presents, prepare cookies & milk for Santa / good child / bad child?
- Santa Claus HQ —> gets wishlist (observer?), lets elfs create gifts and wrap gifts
- Gifts know how they are fabricated
- Santa Claus delivers presents

### Project Proposal:

We want to create a Santa Claus christmas present management system (SCCPMS). Children should be able to write letters to Santa and, if they were good children (and/or put cookies and milk out), get presents.
Santa receives the letters, produces the presents, packs them in gift wrap of different colour and pattern and in the end delivers them to the children’s houses.
